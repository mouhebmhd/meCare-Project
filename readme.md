## 📚 Project Overview

This project aims to **improve health literacy (HL)** by creating a framework that adapts and simplifies medical information according to individual literacy levels and health interests. The goal is to help individuals better understand, interpret, and act upon medical data, ensuring informed decision-making in healthcare.

- 🏥 **Access to health information** is improving with communication technologies.
- 📊 Individuals with low HL often struggle to interpret and evaluate medical data.
- 💡 We propose a **personalized system** that simplifies and adapts this information for easier understanding.

## 🏢 Collaboration

This project is part of the **meCare initiative**, a collaboration between the **University of Lille (France)** and **Towson University (United States)**. It integrates research in:

- 💻 **Computer Science** (technological advancements)
- 🌍 **Humanities & Social Sciences** (user-centered approaches)

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. 📖 **Classify health literacy levels** to adapt medical information based on individual knowledge.
2. 🧩 **Simplify medical literature** to ensure the content is accessible to everyone.
3. 🌐 **Personalize content** according to individual health interests and needs.
